https://www.wetech-alliance.com/2025/10/07/powering-sustainable-innovation-handy-bros-journey-with-wetech-and-the-i-d-e-a-fund,The story of Handy Bros,"Embarking on a path of innovation isn’t just about having the best idea; it’s about having the right support network to transform that idea into reality. In southern Ontario, WEtech Alliance and five other Regional Innovation Centres (RICs) play a vital role in nurturing businesses toward success. Through the i.d.e.a.

In southern Ontario, WEtech Alliance and five other Regional Innovation Centres (RICs) play a vital role in nurturing businesses toward success. Through the i.d.e.a. Fund™, backed by the Government of Canada through the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario), WEtech supported 12 high-potential startups with $20,000 in matching seed funding and access to a network of industry experts.
“If we don’t have the right answer, we reach out to our RIC network and find someone who does,” says Susy Kustra, WEtech Alliance’s manager of programs and client experience. “That collaboration helps us support clients in a more targeted and meaningful way.”











“The Government of Canada is proud to champion WEtech Alliance as they fuel the ambitions of our next generation of entrepreneurs. Through the i.d.e.a. Fund, WEtech is paving the way for results to strengthen and future-proof our economy in the era of entrepreneurs. This is what happens when public will and entrepreneurial spirit come together: bold innovation, resilient communities, and a brighter tomorrow for all Canadians. I’m proud to support accelerators and success stories in Southwestern Ontario.”
 
— The Honourable Evan Solomon, Minister of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Innovation and Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario










The success of the i.d.e.a. Fund is grounded in the strength of its ecosystem. Founders benefit not only from capital but also from access to a deep pool of mentors and advisors.  WEtech’s extensive mentor network plays a crucial role in guiding founders as they build their businesses.
Kustra highlights this value:
“Our business advisory team helps companies by opening doors to local partners and resources. These connections often lead to solutions founders wouldn’t find on their own.”
This mentorship-first approach often proves more valuable than funding alone, helping startups develop resilience and strategic clarity.


The story of Handy Bros



One of the standout companies in the i.d.e.a. Fund’s third cohort is Handy Bros, an HVAC service provider based in the Chatham region. Founded in 1959 by Jack and Murray Handy, the company was later acquired by Nic and Mitch White, who were driven by a passion for HVAC and a vision to grow the company while pushing the industry’s boundaries.
Kaleena Crydermann, Handy Bros’ Director of Strategic Growth, shared the company’s transformation. The new leadership team didn’t measure success by revenue alone; they pursued innovation and customer-focused change in an industry long overdue for disruption.
“We’re always looking at our business to see where we can innovate, not for the sake of change, but to better serve our customers,” says Crydermann.
The i.d.e.a. Fund was a natural fit for Handy Bros. Having previously experienced WEtech’s support, the partners re-engaged through the program to take their innovation to the next level. When WEtech was invited to see the work being done, the leadership’s commitment to forward-thinking design and operational excellence was unmistakable – they are a company on the cutting edge of industrial innovation.

With the support of the i.d.e.a. Fund, Handy Bros developed a game-changing loading device known as the POD, a custom-designed aluminum repair and installation unit that significantly improved service speed and quality. This innovation made Handy Bros the fastest HVAC service provider in the region.
Creating this new repair pod system marked a key milestone in Handy Bros’ entrepreneurial journey and required a distinct design approach, a testament to its strategic and executional strength.
“The i.d.e.a. Fund connected innovation with opportunity and helped us push the needle in an industry long overdue for change,” adds Crydermann.
While WEtech provided crucial guidance from expert Growth Coach Gary Chan, Handy Bros also relied on its internal research and development team to deliver on its ambitious goals.
Cryderman offers this guidance to entrepreneurs:
“If you suffer from analysis paralysis, you’re never going to push the needle forward. Progress comes with taking chances. Don’t fear failure, embrace change to drive innovation.”


Building a future through sustainable innovation



To aspiring innovators, the pathway to sustainability and growth begins with understanding and embracing the real-world applications of the circular economy. By providing access to educational courses, especially those developed in partnership with institutions like the University of Guelph, entrepreneurs are equipped with the clarity and foundational knowledge needed to turn their vision into action.
According to WEtech’s Susy Kustra, investments in forward-thinking initiatives like the i.d.e.a. Fund are essential to shaping Ontario’s circular economy future. Sustainability plays a pivotal role and is at the core of this program’s success. Kustra also emphasizes the importance of expanding such initiatives across regional partners and beyond to drive broader impact.
“Sustainability isn’t just recycling; it’s about creating new value right from the start. RICs should advocate for sustainability routinely. It shouldn’t be sporadic; it must be ingrained in our daily operations,” she says.
Through the combined efforts of the i.d.e.a. Fund, WEtech Alliance, and Regional Innovation Centres across southern Ontario, innovators gain access to the funding, mentorship, and resources needed to bring impactful ideas to life.
In addition to Handy Bros Home Comfort Inc., WEtech Alliance’s third i.d.e.a. Fund cohort includes 11 other businesses across a variety of sectors: Evolution Data, Grays Shop, Crop Defenders, Fetherstill Inc., DuroByte Inc., Terranova UAV, ESTARE INC., Frugalicious, Iceberg Cyber Inc., Sherwood Innovations Inc., and Wild Ones Organics.
Discover how this powerful network is transforming industries and empowering entrepreneurs to build scalable, sustainable ventures. Whether you’re just starting or ready to scale, the support you need is within reach.

September 4, 2024 Windsor, Ontario – Southern Ontario’s diverse network of promising entrepreneurs and businesses fuels Canada’s potential as a leader in clean technology. This is why the i.d.e.a. Fund was launched in 2022, and has provided support for nearly 245 businesses focused on green technology and clean innovation succeed through access to capital and mentoring to commercialize innovative technologies.
Today, on behalf of the Honourable Filomena Tassi, Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario), Lloyd Longfield, Member of Parliament for Guelph, announced Government of Canada support toward the continuation of the i.d.e.a. Fund, while visiting Boundless Accelerator in Guelph, Ontario.

Fund to launch a third cohort of its important programming, in partnership with five Regional Innovation Centres (RIC) partners: Boundless Accelerator™, Innovate Niagara, Innovation Factory, Launch Lab, TechAlliance of Southwestern Ontario, and WEtech Alliance. This new intake will provide up to 145 companies across Ontario with access to business support and seed funding to develop and/or re-design green products, services, processes and technologies to reduce their environmental footprint.




Affinity, pictured, participated in the highly successful first cohort of i.d.e.a. Fund.

https://www.wetech-alliance.com/2024/01/09/i-d-e-a-fund-companies-focus-on-sustainability-taking-a-bite-out-of-food-waste,“Our federal government continues to proudly partner with WEtech Alliance to support the next generation of innovators and job creators in our community through the i.d.e.a Fund.”,"As the global population continues to grow, so does the demand for food.","As the global population continues to grow, so does the demand for food.
Over the past several years, the food and beverage industry has been under immense pressure to not only keep up with these increased requirements but to also do so in a more sustainable way, producing and processing larger quantities of food while simultaneously mitigating its environmental impact.
So how can the sector do more while minimizing its carbon footprint? In an effort to solve some of our society’s most pressing food-related issues, a dynamic group of entrepreneurs in the second WEtech Alliance-supported cohort of the i.d.e.a. Fund program have taken up that challenge, creating a variety of low-carbon, sustainable products and innovative processes aimed at reducing food waste, carbon emissions and single use plastics.
The i.d.e.a. Fund, a southern Ontario-focused initiative, helps clean innovation firms unlock their potential and access the capital and mentoring needed to commercialize innovative technologies.
The program fosters inclusion, diversity, environment and acceleration while contributing to a green economic recovery. Supported by a $10-million Government of Canada investment through the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario) the i.d.e.a. Fund is being delivered by six Regional Innovation Centres (RICs): Boundless Accelerator, Haltech, Innovate Niagara, Innovation Factory, Tech Alliance of Southwestern Ontario and WEtech Alliance.
Through the program, each RIC is able to distribute a maximum of $30,000 in matching seed funding to select innovative businesses in various sectors including medtech, agritech, social enterprise, advanced manufacturing, and more.
“Canada’s growing green technology sector is solving complex problems while creating jobs. Our government is encouraged to see the promising companies that the i.d.e.a. Fund is supporting,” says the Honourable Filomena Tassi, Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario. “The innovations that Canadian companies are bringing to the table will help Canadians lead healthier and more prosperous lives. It is critical that we continue to support businesses that provide positive, sustainable solutions.”


“Our federal government continues to proudly partner with WEtech Alliance to support the next generation of innovators and job creators in our community through the i.d.e.a Fund.”



Since the launch of the program in May 2022, WEtech Alliance has been able to provide $1.2 million of seed funding to 40 businesses in the Windsor-Essex and Chatham-Kent areas and beyond.
“Our federal government continues to proudly partner with WEtech Alliance to support the next generation of innovators and job creators in our community through the i.d.e.a. Fund,” said Irek Kusmierczyk, Member of Parliament Windsor—Tecumseh.
While the second cohort features early-stage developers from across a broad spectrum of industries, WEtech’s i.d.e.a. Fund program coordinator Susy Kustra said she noticed this year’s group included a large cluster of companies focused on the food production sector.
“It’s interesting that nearly half of the companies in the program are in the food and food storage industry,” says Kustra.
“We have companies like u10sils and Dalcini Stainless, whose focus is recyclable, stainless-steel kitchenware and utensils to combat the issue of single use plastics,” she continues. “On the other end of the spectrum, we have CarbonOne, which has created a cutting-edge software platform that accurately measures the carbon footprint of food and beverage products, helping to bring clarity and transparency to the industry.”
Kustra notes there are also several companies in the plant-based foods sector including Choose Life Foods, which produces plant-based, vegan Jamaican patties that eliminate the need for resource-intensive, high methane gas producing beef.
“These are just a few examples of the projects funded by the i.d.e.a. Fund program that are helping us progress towards a more sustainable, green economy,” she adds.
In addition to funding, the program also provides specialized industry expertise to develop growth plans and related strategies in areas such as talent attraction, raising follow-on investment, product development and quantification of product benefits/market value propositions, commercialization of intellectual property and market diversification.


“The work WEtech is doing with i.d.e.a. Fund in the green recovery space is incredible. The quality and calibre of companies that are participating in the program are unmatched.“



Camille Kennedy, an experienced marketer who specializes in B2B and B2C marketing for tech startups, is one such industry expert, lending her years of knowledge to help i.d.e.a. Fund companies with everything from ROI driving marketing and sales tactics to strategic business growth. Like Kustra, Kennedy says she is impressed by the work she’s seen from Cohort 2 participants.
“The work WEtech is doing with i.d.e.a. Fund in the green recovery space is incredible. The quality and calibre of companies that are participating in the program are unmatched,” says Kennedy. “Every food and beverage company I’ve had the benefit of mentoring and coaching through i.d.e.a. Fund is a change-maker and doing something progressive and novel in the space—something worth talking about.”
For example, says Kennedy, Ag-Tronic Control Systems Inc.
“Its best-in-class paper-based fruit sticker (Accu-Label) is helping divert compost loads from ending up in the landfill,” she shares. “The company recently received the very first acceptance of any label into the compost, by Compost Manufacturing Alliance.”
Biofect is another amazing company, she adds, with a very tangible and affordable solution to the sugar epidemic. The company is leveraging precision fermentation by combining modern biotechnology with traditional fermentation to sustainably produce super sweet protein alternatives, like Brazzein, at scale.
Other Cohort 2 i.d.e.a. Fund companies in the food space include Alborz Fine Foods, which has developed an IoT/machine learning based technology to change any regular commercial fridge and freezer into a “smart” one, reducing food spoilage, as well as Happy Era, specializing in high-protein, low-sugar muffin mixes made from up-cycled barley protein.
There’s also Ardra, notes Kustra, which makes novel food ingredients to address major challenges in the emerging food industry. Its ingredients target problems of taste and nutrition in multibillion dollar markets such as plant-based meats and nutritional beverages. The underlying technology is based on precision fermentation, where its proprietary patented microbes convert sugars into high-value ingredients, like animal-free heme, which the company is using to deliver meaty taste to plant-based products.
“Companies like these are progressing in food innovation in Canada, with the help of much-needed innovation dollars from programs like i.d.e.a. Fund,” says Kennedy.
While there have been plenty of exciting developments from these i.d.e.a. Fund ‘foodpreneurs’, Kustra points out that the rest of the cohort is also making significant advancements in everything from sustainable fashion to cosmetics, home care products and autonomous services.
In addition to those in the food industry, WEtech’s second i.d.e.a. Fund cohort includes 12 other businesses across a variety of sectors: Carbon Neutral Club, Dreams Jumper, Everyday Chemist, Guests on Earth, Laszlo Energy Services, Kevares Autonomous Services, Osmosis Glow, Picsume, Prisum Coatings Canada, Steadiwear, SwapWear and RealTime7.

Fund partners at Technology Councils of North America’s Summer Conference in Seattle



WEtech Alliance and partners are thrilled to announce that the i.d.e.a. Fund has been recognized on the international stage, winning an Award for innovation in Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.
The 5th annual TECNA Innovation Award, sponsored by Victoria State Government Australia, were held Thursday, August 10th, in conjunction with the Technology Councils of North America (TECNA) Summer Conference in Seattle, Washington, hosted by TECNA member, Washington Technology Industry Association (WTIA), and presented by CompTIA.
WEtech Alliance’s President and CEO, Yvonne Pilon, and Director of Venture Services, Adam Castle, were on hand to accept the award on behalf of all i.d.e.a. Fund partners.




The i.d.e.a. Fund is a southern Ontario-focused initiative that was developed to help clean growth firms access the tools they need to succeed by providing financial and business advisory supports to develop or redesign green products, services, processes and technologies that reduce impacts to our environment and create made-in-Canada climate change solutions.
The program fosters inclusion and diversity, with a focus on continuing Canada’s transition to a green economy.
“This award is a testament to the collective effort of our team, our partners, and the inspiring individuals who have participated in the i.d.e.a Fund Program,” says Susy Kustra, WEtech Alliance’s Program Manager of the i.d.e.a Fund Program. “Together, we are reshaping the future of green innovation, making it more diverse, equitable, and inclusive.”
Supported by a $10-million Government of Canada investment through the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario), the i.d.e.a. Fund is led by Innovation Guelph, in partnership with five Regional Innovation Centres (RICs): WEtech Alliance, Haltech, Innovate Niagara, Innovation Factory and TechAlliance of Southwestern Ontario.
“We are thrilled and honoured that the i.d.e.a. Fund program was recognized as an innovative initiative in Diversity, Equity and Inclusion,” says Alison Crumblehulme, CEO of Innovation Guelph. “This collaboration aimed to address a gap in our ecosystem as it relates to underrepresented entrepreneurs by reducing barriers and providing equal opportunities to future-proof their businesses and build capacity for long-term sustainability. The brilliant founders and business leaders we have worked with throughout the program have been nothing short of inspirational.”
The Technology Councils of North America represents over 60 technology associations spanning the United States and Canada, collectively supporting more than 22,000 tech-related companies.
The TECNA Innovation Awards celebrate the achievements of tech associations and councils across North America, acknowledging their exceptional contributions to the industry. Out of six distinct categories, the i.d.e.a. Fund secured the award for Innovation in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.
“I am proud of our partners WEtech Alliance, Innovation Guelph and all Regional Innovation Centres on this tremendous international recognition for skillfully delivering vital support through the i.d.e.a. Fund that is growing cleantech innovators and job creators across Southern Ontario, in partnership with our federal government thanks to a $10 million federal investment. That is partnership delivering prosperity and sustainability.” says Irek Kusmierczyk, Member of Parliament Windsor-Tecumseh.

WEtech Alliance accepted the Award on behalf of i.d.e.a. Fund partners at Technology Councils of North America’s Summer Conference in Seattle

i.d.e.a. Fund™ Recognized on the International Stage with Innovation AwardAugust 18, 2023in

WEtech Alliance accepted the Award on behalf of i.d.e.a. Fund partners at Technology Councils of North America’s Summer Conference in Seattle



WEtech Alliance and partners are thrilled to announce that the i.d.e.a. Fund has been recognized on the international stage, winning an Award for innovation in Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.
The 5th annual TECNA Innovation Award, sponsored by Victoria State Government Australia, were held Thursday, August 10th, in conjunction with the Technology Councils of North America (TECNA) Summer Conference in Seattle, Washington, hosted by TECNA member, Washington Technology Industry Association (WTIA), and presented by CompTIA.
WEtech Alliance’s President and CEO, Yvonne Pilon, and Director of Venture Services, Adam Castle, were on hand to accept the award on behalf of all i.d.e.a. Fund partners.




The i.d.e.a. Fund is a southern Ontario-focused initiative that was developed to help clean growth firms access the tools they need to succeed by providing financial and business advisory supports to develop or redesign green products, services, processes and technologies that reduce impacts to our environment and create made-in-Canada climate change solutions.
The program fosters inclusion and diversity, with a focus on continuing Canada’s transition to a green economy.
“This award is a testament to the collective effort of our team, our partners, and the inspiring individuals who have participated in the i.d.e.a Fund Program,” says Susy Kustra, WEtech Alliance’s Program Manager of the i.d.e.a Fund Program. “Together, we are reshaping the future of green innovation, making it more diverse, equitable, and inclusive.”
Supported by a $10-million Government of Canada investment through the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario), the i.d.e.a. Fund is led by Innovation Guelph, in partnership with five Regional Innovation Centres (RICs): WEtech Alliance, Haltech, Innovate Niagara, Innovation Factory and TechAlliance of Southwestern Ontario.
“We are thrilled and honoured that the i.d.e.a. Fund program was recognized as an innovative initiative in Diversity, Equity and Inclusion,” says Alison Crumblehulme, CEO of Innovation Guelph. “This collaboration aimed to address a gap in our ecosystem as it relates to underrepresented entrepreneurs by reducing barriers and providing equal opportunities to future-proof their businesses and build capacity for long-term sustainability. The brilliant founders and business leaders we have worked with throughout the program have been nothing short of inspirational.”
The Technology Councils of North America represents over 60 technology associations spanning the United States and Canada, collectively supporting more than 22,000 tech-related companies.
The TECNA Innovation Awards celebrate the achievements of tech associations and councils across North America, acknowledging their exceptional contributions to the industry. Out of six distinct categories, the i.d.e.a. Fund secured the award for Innovation in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.
“I am proud of our partners WEtech Alliance, Innovation Guelph and all Regional Innovation Centres on this tremendous international recognition for skillfully delivering vital support through the i.d.e.a. Fund that is growing cleantech innovators and job creators across Southern Ontario, in partnership with our federal government thanks to a $10 million federal investment. That is partnership delivering prosperity and sustainability.” says Irek Kusmierczyk, Member of Parliament Windsor-Tecumseh.




Quick Facts

Across southern Ontario, 125 companies received non-repayable contributions of up to $3,750,000 in Cohort 2.
In 2022, 117 companies received non-repayable contributions of $3,500,000 through Cohort 1.
Led by Innovation Guelph, the fund is being delivered in partnership with five other Regional Innovation Centres (RICs): WEtech Alliance (Windsor-Essex and Chatham-Kent), Haltech (Halton Region), Innovate Niagara, Innovation Factory (Hamilton), and TechAlliance of Southwestern Ontario (London).
Fifty percent of the businesses receiving support through the fund will be owned or led by women and 30 percent owned or led by Indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, Black communities, racialized communities and members of the LGBTQ2+ community.
WEtech Alliance has been a member of TECNA since 2018.
WEtech Alliance previously won the Creative Marketing Award at TECNA’s inaugural Innovation Awards in Madison, Wisconsin in 2019.
In 2022 Windsor-Tecumseh M.P. Irek Kusmierczyk won the Canadian Official of the Year Innovation Award

Today, 21 companies received non-repayable contributions of $630,000 from WEtech Alliance, in partnership with Innovation Guelph, through Cohort 2 of the Government of Canada-supported i.d.e.a Fund.
The i.d.e.a. Fund is a southern Ontario-focused initiative that was developed to help clean growth firms access the tools they need to succeed by providing financial and business advisory supports to develop or redesign green products, services, processes and technologies that reduce impacts to our environment and create made-in-Canada climate change solutions.
The program fosters inclusion and diversity, with a focus on continuing Canada’s transition to a green economy. Supported by a $10-million Government of Canada investment through the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario), the i.d.e.a. Fund is being delivered by six Regional Innovation Centres (RICs): Innovation Guelph, WEtech Alliance, Haltech, Innovate Niagara, Innovation Factory and TechAlliance of Southwestern Ontario.
“Business owners in southern Ontario are making incredible strides to promote green products and build a clean economy. The i.d.e.a. Fund offers financial and advisory support to entrepreneurs who are creating made-in-Canada solutions to our everyday problems,” said the Honourable Filomena Tassi, Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario. “The Government of Canada is happy to support the i.d.e.a. Fund as they work with the next generation of Canada’s entrepreneurs to enable them to reach their full potential.”

In 2022, 117 companies received non-repayable contributions of $3,500,000 through Cohort 1..
Led by Innovation Guelph, the fund is being delivered in partnership with five Regional Innovation Centres (RICs): Haltech (Halton Region), Innovate Niagara, Innovation Factory (Hamilton), TechAlliance of Southwestern Ontario (London) and WEtech Alliance (Windsor and Chatham-Kent).
Fifty percent of the businesses receiving support through the fund will be owned or led by women and 30 percent owned or led by Indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, Black communities, racialized communities and members of the LGBTQ2+ community.

Today, 21 companies received non-repayable contributions of $630,000 from WEtech Alliance, in partnership with Innovation Guelph, through Cohort 2 of the Government of Canada-supported i.d.e.a Fund.
The i.d.e.a. Fund is a southern Ontario-focused initiative that was developed to help clean growth firms access the tools they need to succeed by providing financial and business advisory supports to develop or redesign green products, services, processes and technologies that reduce impacts to our environment and create made-in-Canada climate change solutions.
The program fosters inclusion and diversity, with a focus on continuing Canada’s transition to a green economy. Supported by a $10-million Government of Canada investment through the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario), the i.d.e.a. Fund is being delivered by six Regional Innovation Centres (RICs): Innovation Guelph, WEtech Alliance, Haltech, Innovate Niagara, Innovation Factory and TechAlliance of Southwestern Ontario.
“Business owners in southern Ontario are making incredible strides to promote green products and build a clean economy. The i.d.e.a. Fund offers financial and advisory support to entrepreneurs who are creating made-in-Canada solutions to our everyday problems,” said the Honourable Filomena Tassi, Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario. “The Government of Canada is happy to support the i.d.e.a. Fund as they work with the next generation of Canada’s entrepreneurs to enable them to reach their full potential.”

Quick Facts

Across southern Ontario, 125 companies will receive non-repayable contributions of $3,750,000 in Cohort 2.
In 2022, 117 companies received non-repayable contributions of $3,500,000 through Cohort 1..
Led by Innovation Guelph, the fund is being delivered in partnership with five Regional Innovation Centres (RICs): Haltech (Halton Region), Innovate Niagara, Innovation Factory (Hamilton), TechAlliance of Southwestern Ontario (London) and WEtech Alliance (Windsor and Chatham-Kent).
Fifty percent of the businesses receiving support through the fund will be owned or led by women and 30 percent owned or led by Indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, Black communities, racialized communities and members of the LGBTQ2+ community.

May 1, 2023 — Waterloo, ON— The Accelerator Centre (AC) is pleased to announce the 50 companies progressing to Phase 2 of AC:Studio. Phase 1 of the innovative three-phase entrepreneurial support program was launched in June of 2022 with a $10-million investment from the Government of Canada, through the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario), and aims to provide 100 high-potential, early-stage companies with up to $100,000 in seed funding by March 2025— creating 1,000 new jobs along the way.
In Phase 1, the AC selected 100 high-potential startups and supported them with an initial seed funding of $20,000 and access to the AC’s award-winning mentorship programming.
Of the 100 companies selected in Phase 1:

29% are working on cleantech/sustainability-focused initiatives
26% are working on medtech/healthtech solutions
63% are women-led
5% are indigenous-led
26% are newcomer-led
57 are youth-led (under 40)

To date, the program has made a significant impact, creating 410 new jobs in southern Ontario. Collectively, the companies have also raised $28 million in additional investment and generated $8 million in combined revenue.
“Our aim with the AC:Studio program is to identify startup founders with the potential to build globally successful businesses that make significant economic impact,” says AC CEO, Jay Krishnan. “Through this new model, we can quickly identify the best-of-the-best and double down on supporting those companies. We’re excited and encouraged by our early results and the positive feedback from founders, and we look forward to the next phase of this high- impact model. Through the next phase of the program, we intend to provide companies with more capital, corporate partnerships, strategic mentorship, and additional hands- on tactical support—accelerating the time it takes them to reach escape velocity and scale”.
In Phase 2, founders will receive an additional $30,000 in non-repayable seed funding from FedDev Ontario, and one year of mentorship and tactical support from the AC’s network of mentors and service provider partners.

Quotes:




“The entrepreneurial grit and tenacity of the 100 companies that started the program with us in the fall is truly inspirational. Selecting the top 50 from this group was challenging because the talent and quality of the ideas in southern Ontario are incredible. We’re confident the 50 startups we’ve selected to move into Phase 2 of the program will continue their rapid growth trajectory and continue to create jobs and keep Ontario at the forefront of the Canadian innovation economy.”
– Jay Krishnan, CEO, Accelerator Centre




“The Accelerator Centre is working with entrepreneurs and startups to bring new cutting-edge ideas and solutions to Canadians. The second phase of the Accelerator Centre’s AC:Studio program will provide 50 companies with access to mentoring services and funding that will help them reach their potential. We are happy to support this program that will create good jobs for Canadians and help boost Canada’s innovative technology sector.”
– The Honourable Filomena Tassi, Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario




“Phase 2 of this project will support the development of high-potential start-up companies right here in Waterloo and across southern Ontario. Our region is an innovation hub and the strategic investments our government is making will continue to help more Canadian innovators, entrepreneurs, and businesses to set roots and grow.”
– The Honourable Bardish Chagger, Member of Parliament for the Riding of Waterloo

https://www.wetech-alliance.com/2022/12/02/climate-neutral-wins-20k-top-prize-in-wetech-alliances-scaleup-accelerator,“This program continues to be a shining example of the diverse companies creating a new face for our local economy.”,,"“This program continues to be a shining example of the diverse companies creating a new face for our local economy.”



On Thursday, December 1st, five scaling companies across a diverse cross-section of regional sectors had the opportunity to make their pitch in front of a group of seasoned investors, industry experts, and celebrity judge, Vivian Kaye. The scaleups are part of the sixth cohort to graduate from the award-winning ScaleUP Accelerator program, launched by WEtech Alliance and generously powered in 2022 by Libro Credit Union and Invest WindsorEssex.
“This program continues to be a shining example of the diverse companies creating a new face for our local economy.” said Stephen MacKenzie, President and CEO at Invest WindsorEssex. “This year is no exception, with participants in Automobility, Healthtech, Fintech, and Greentech, Windsor-Essex continues to be a region of makers and growers. What we make and how we grow is evolving, and companies like the ones in this year’s ScaleUP cohort are leading the charge.”
The theme of this year’s program centered around adapting to uncertainty, and building flexibility into business planning. Participants learned from renowned experts and mentors on how to apply positive psychology, financial modeling, and global economic outlooks to their individual business circumstances, in order to fuel their decision making process.
“At Libro, we know that every business is human-powered,” said Lori Atkinson, Regional Manager (Windsor-Essex) at Libro Credit Union. “That is why we love that the goal of this program isn’t just about more sales, or more revenue. The focus of ScaleUP is providing the people behind these businesses with the support they need to become more confident in their decision making, and to view every challenge as an opportunity to be uncovered.”


“This win isn’t just a win for Climate Neutral, this is a win for the environment and all municipalities who need it.”



The four-month accelerator program provides one-on-one mentoring, cohort sessions, and access to provincial, national and global networks of programs and mentors valued at over $78,000 per participant. Highlights of this year’s program included Psychological Resiliency Coaching with Clinical Psychologist Dr. Andrea Dinardo, sales training with “The Story Architect” and Former Dell executive, Kevin Smith, and meetings with local investors through the Windsor Essex Capital Angel Network (WECAN).
While the program content evolves annually based on the needs of the cohort, tools were designed to help the participants imagine what’s next for their businesses and prepare them for the challenges they may face in the future.
“The key is to strike a balance between encouraging activity that builds momentum in the here and now, while also delivering resources and skills upgrades that will help in the future,” said Adam Castle, Director of Venture Services at WEtech Alliance. “Four months goes by in the blink of an eye and, even though the program is designed to be fast-paced, we want to help contribute to the longevity and sustainable growth of these businesses far beyond their graduation from ScaleUP.”
Following a virtual “Dragons’ Den” style pitch that measured the cohort company’s growth over the course of the program, Climate Neutral came out as the winner.
“This course has meant a lot to me,” says Climate Neutral founder Kyle Bassett. “This win isn’t just a win for Climate Neutral, this is a win for the environment and all municipalities who need it.”
To date, ScaleUP has seen 30 graduates, over 22 million dollars in revenue earned, and 168 jobs created.
Applications for the seventh cohort will open in summer 2023. To learn more about the ScaleUP Tech Accelerator program visit www.wetech-alliance.com/scaleup.

MEDIA RELEASE via Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario


August 16, 2022—Hamilton, ON
Black entrepreneurs are a vital contributor to Canada’s economy and our nation’s rich culture, though they are often faced with barriers to success. The Government of Canada recognizes the importance of these contributions and is proud to support projects that provide Black entrepreneurs with support and contribute to building a strong, inclusive and equitable future for all Canadians.
Today, the Honourable Helena Jaczek, Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario), announced a non-repayable investment of over $1.9 million for Empowerment Squared. Empowerment Squared is a not-for-profit organization that empowers newcomer, racialized and marginalized communities in Canada through mentorship, access to post-secondary education, professional skills development, entrepreneurship, sports and recreation in the greater Hamilton and Windsor areas.
With this investment, through the Black Entrepreneurship Program (BEP) Ecosystem Fund, Empowerment Squared will create the Southwestern Ontario Black Business Network. This consortium of partners will provide Black entrepreneurs in the Hamilton and Windsor areas with advisory services, mentorship, entrepreneurial training and networking opportunities to help them succeed.
Today’s investment will support the creation of 80 new jobs and 275 Black entrepreneurs and reinforces the Government of Canada’s commitment to removing barriers to success and celebrating the positive economic impacts of Black entrepreneurs in Canada

Companies in southern Ontario that focus on environmental impacts are vital to creating jobs and bringing new, innovative technologies to market that continue Canada’s transition to a green economy. The i.d.e.a. Fund was developed to help clean growth firms have the tools they need to succeed by providing financial and business advisory supports to develop or redesign green products, services, processes and technologies that reduce impacts to our environment and create made-in-Canada climate change solutions.
The Government of Canada, through the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario), provided Innovation Guelph with $10 million to lead the delivery of the i.d.e.a Fund in partnership with five Regional Innovation Centres (RICs) across southwestern Ontario. Up to 240 high-potential clean growth companies will receive support through Cohorts 1 and 2 of the i.d.e.a. Fund.
Today, 19 companies received non-repayable contributions totalling $567,700 from WEtech Alliance, in partnership with Innovation Guelph, through the Government of Canada-supported i.d.e.a Fund.




The WEtech Alliance-supported companies in Cohort 1 are:





















Yvonne Pilon

President & CEO, WEtech Alliance




“Today’s announcement is an example of what can be accomplished when industry and government work together to accelerate the evolution to a green, net-zero future. Among the 19 successful projects announced, a wide variety of economic sectors will benefit including regional food production; renewable energy; transportation; telecommunications; healthcare; and manufacturing. Entrepreneurs are drivers of change and innovation and WEtech Alliance is proud to partner with FedDev Ontario and fellow Regional Innovation Centres to help shape a more inclusive, equitable and sustainable future for Windsor-Essex, Chatham-Kent and beyond.”




















The Honourable Helena Jaczek

Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario





“The Government of Canada-funded i.d.e.a. Fund is providing Canadian entrepreneurs and businesses with the support they need to produce innovative solutions that continue Canada’s transition to a green economy. This investment will create good, secure jobs for Canadians, protect Canadian supply chains, and ensure that the Canadian economy is positioned to be a global leader, now and into the future.”





















Adam Castle

Director of Venture Services, WEtech Alliance




“In recent years, we have seen our entrepreneurial community rise to every occasion they have encountered. The challenges in front of them proved insignificant compared to the innovative thinking that drove them forward through adversity. Climate change is a challenge that our entire world faces, and once again, entrepreneurs and their ability to adapt will be a major key to the perseverance of our communities, our economy, and our country. It is an honour to assist in the delivery of these funds, and in the execution of the brilliant, equitable, and environmentally sustainable projects that make up the first cohort of this transformative program.”














Quick Facts

Across southern Ontario, approximately 120 companies received non-repayable contributions of up to $3,600,000 in Cohort 1.
Led by Innovation Guelph, the fund is being delivered in partnership with five Regional Innovation Centres (RICs): Haltech (Halton Region), Innovate Niagara, Innovation Factory (Hamilton), TechAlliance of Southwestern Ontario (London) and WEtech Alliance (Windsor and Chatham-Kent).
Fifty percent of the businesses receiving support through the fund will be owned or led by women and 30 percent owned or led by Indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, Black communities, racialized communities and members of the LGBTQ2+ community.

MEDIA RELEASE via Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario

June 6, 2022—Waterloo, ON— Delivering on its vision to create the #1 full-stack startup hub in the world, the Accelerator Centre (AC) is announcing the launch of a new, regional-first hybrid venture studio program to support early-stage startups across southern Ontario.










With $10 million in funding support from the Government of Canada, through the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario), the unique program combines the best of the AC’s flagship program, AC:Incubate, with the globally successful venture studio model to create the new program, named AC:Studio.








Through AC:Studio, the AC will work with existing early-stage companies across southern Ontario to provide critical funding and support. Additionally, the AC will work to curate new businesses by matching aspiring and serial founders with high-impact IP from industry and academia. The three-phase program will provide 100 high-potential, early-stage companies with up to $100,000 in seed funding between now and March of 2025.







The program is an expansion on the AC’s long-running AC JumpStart program, which provided $30,000 in seed funding grants and mentorship to 318 companies from 2014 to 2021. Uniquely, the new AC:Studio program will provide startup founders with the funding and mentorship the AC is known for, while expanding supports to include training and tactical resources from ecosystem partners like SnapPea Design, Uvaro, and Conestoga Colleges’ Gig Lab to help founders execute and accelerate their time to market. The program takes a regional approach, working with Regional Innovation Centre (RIC) partners WEtech, Alliance, and Innovate Niagara to identify and curate high-potential startups for participation in the program.






Application Information
Applications for the program are open from June 6, 2022 until July 1, 2022 with the 100 selected startups beginning programming in September of 2022. Visit www.ac-studio.ca for more information or to apply for the program.




Quotes:


“There is no doubt, startup founders need enhanced access to capital, particularly seed funding. The AC has long played an important role in Waterloo ecosystem by providing that capital through the AC JumpStart program. Today, we’re proud to be able to continue working with our partners to provide that critical funding through the AC:Studio model. However, we also know that today’s early-stage founders need more intensive supports to accelerate their success. Optimally, they need funding, mentorship, access to talent, and tactical help getting the job done. That’s why we’ve gone beyond the status quo with our hybrid accelerator/venture studio model and brought together a full network of support that curates, funds, and accelerates startups to global success.”
– Jay Krishnan, CEO, Accelerator Centre














“Today’s investment in the Waterloo Accelerator Centre and the Venture Studio Innovation Program will provide Canadian entrepreneurs with the access to the support, mentorship and services they need for growth and success. Supporting Canadian jobs and economic growth in Canada’s technology sector is a priority for the Government of Canada. We are proud to support this program that will create good jobs for Canadians and help secure Canada’s place as a global leader in the technology sector.”
– The Honourable Helena Jaczek, Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario




















“This investment in the Waterloo Accelerator Centre will help our region further develop its network in leading-edge innovation. This project will support the continuing development of a healthy pipeline of high-potential startup companies in cleantech, nanotech, and healthtech, and create and maintain 1,000 highly skilled jobs right here in the Waterloo Region and across southwestern Ontario.”
– The Honourable Bardish Chagger, Member of Parliament for the Riding of Waterloo































“Commercialization skills are a critical success factor in a startup’s growth. The war on talent is intensifying and we need Canadian companies to have a strong foundation for sales motions so they can be successful in commercializing innovations and onboarding sales talent. Uvaro has been helping hundreds of tech companies build and find successful sales talent. We’re excited to partner with the AC and FedDev Ontario to support the success of the reformatted Venture Studio model and build skills around sales excellence and access to commercialization talent right from the start.”
– Joseph Fung, Co-Founder & CEO at Uvaro












































“We are excited to share our experience with the founders in this new program and to support the growth of the region in a meaningful way. Deciding to go down the path of entrepreneurship is a big step. The hardest part is discovering what you don’t know, and how to execute on the advice you’re given. This program changes that, by allowing us and our partners in this program, to work with these companies directly. We will drive them to validation and execution faster and more efficiently than ever before.”
– Steven Fyke, Founder of SnapPea Design












































































“We are pleased to support the launch of AC:Studio and help early-stage startups access the talent and tactical support they need from freelancers in the Gig Lab and on conestogagigs.ca. Engaging the region’s unique ecosystem of complementary incubators in this project is good for all entrepreneurs and will play a positive role in ensuring the economic health of both our region and the province.”
– Rose Mastnak, Director, Conestoga Entrepreneurship Collective













































































































































“The Accelerator Centre has developed one of the most unique accelerator experiences and startups hubs in the world. This partnership gives high growth entrepreneurs access to world class support, global networks, seed funding and even more importantly, access to other high-end entrepreneurs that are going to push them and support them along their journey. WEtech Alliance looks forward to working together to ensure that early-stage startups from across southern Ontario, including right here in Windsor-Essex and Chatham-Kent, have the opportunity to start up, scale up, and become the next generation of Canadian anchor companies.”
– Adam Frye, Director of Operations and Partnerships at WEtech Alliance.










































































































































































































































“As one of Ontario’s Regional Innovation Centres, Innovate Niagara works with high-potential startups in Niagara, delivering the structure, services and resources entrepreneurs need to start and scale innovation-based companies. We are thrilled to partner with this network to expand access to funding and mentorship for early-stage founders across southern Ontario. There is no greater support we can offer high-potential companies in their infancy than concentrated, expert-level mentorship to ensure companies develop a strong foundation, as well as providing them with access to capital to help commercialize their products. This program is built to do just that, and we are pleased to be part of it.”
– Jeff Chesebrough, CEO, Innovate Niagara

Learn more about the impacts the Agency is having in Southern Ontario by exploring our pivotal projects, our Southern Ontario Spotlight, and FedDev Ontario’s Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn.
About Uvaro
Uvaro started because the old approach to tech hiring is broken. The fastest-growing segment of our economy needs new sales professionals. Finding appropriate training and courses can be challenging for those in this field. Worse yet, when tech companies want to hire diverse talent, established interview practices and company cultures put up barriers. Marginalized people who do accept job offers are often left to flounder by businesses that don’t have effective sales training. We’ve created a better way to grow careers. Instead of preventing access to fulfilling work, we provide accessible training, on-demand support resources, and best-in-class tools that teach participants how to build on their successes. We’re on a mission to help the world’s professionals lead more fulfilling career—from their first job to their last. At Uvaro, we’ve created a better way to help everyday people launch and grow successful and rewarding careers in tech.Conestoga Entrepreneurship Collective The Conestoga Entrepreneurship Collective is dedicated to incubating entrepreneurial potential, equipping members of the Conestoga College community with the skills, strategies, and attitudes to create opportunities that will contribute to the economic development of local, regional, and international communities. Programming includes the Venture Lab universal business incubator, the Sales Lab incubator for high-tech sales careers, and the Gig Lab, Canada’s first business incubator for freelancers.

WEtech Alliance partners with Innovation Guelph to deliver Government of Canada support to bring new technologies to market and create jobs in southwestern Ontario’s clean tech sector 



Southwestern Ontario has a rich and diverse hub of promising early-stage technology companies with innovative solutions to be commercialized to continue Canada’s transition to a green economy.
That is why WEtech Alliance is pleased to partner with Innovation Guelph to deliver the Government of Canada supported i.d.e.a. Fund, a southwestern Ontario-focused initiative to help clean growth firms unlock their potential and access the capital and mentoring needed to commercialize innovative technologies.
Participating businesses (that apply and are accepted to receive support through the Fund) will be provided with seed funding as well as wrap-around support that includes access to specialized expertise and business strategies.
On April 29, the Honourable Helena Jaczek, Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario), announced a non-repayable investment of $10 million for Innovation Guelph to partner with five southwestern Ontario Regional Innovation Centres (RICs): Haltech, Innovate Niagara, Innovation Factory, TechAlliance of Southwestern Ontario and WEtech Alliance to deliver the Fund.




Minister Jaczek, Guelph MP Lloyd Longfield, and members of the 6 southwestern Ontario Regional Innovation Centres at the April 29th i.d.e.a. Fund launch in Guelph.




The fund will support 240 businesses in key sectors connected to the green economy, including agri-innovation, cleantech, and advanced manufacturing, to create and maintain 840 jobs, and commercialize 135 new products, services, processes and technologies.
As part of this partnership, WEtech Alliance will lead on delivering the Fund in Windsor-Essex and Chatham-Kent. WEtech Alliance will help to provide eligible businesses in the region with advisory services and non-repayable contributions of up to $30,000 to provide the working capital needed to support commercialization efforts and growth. This support will assist firms from across the region’s urban and rural communities bring their technologies to market.
For additional details and eligibility criteria, visit www.wetech-alliance.com/idea.





















Yvonne Pilon

President & CEO, WEtech Alliance




“Every day, in communities across Southern Ontario, entrepreneurs are advancing innovative solutions to our nation’s most pressing challenges. Through this collaboration, WEtech Alliance will unlock the capital needed to support a sustainable, inclusive, and equitable recovery for founders & companies and help advance game-changing innovations right here in Windsor-Essex and Chatham-Kent.”




















The Honourable Helena Jaczek

Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario



“The Government of Canada is making smart investments to build a greener and more innovative Canadian economy.”




“Today’s investment in Innovation Guelph and the i.d.e.a. Fund will provide Canadian entrepreneurs and businesses with the support they need to produce innovative solutions that continue Canada’s transition to a green economy. This investment will create good, secure jobs for Canadians, protect Canadian supply chains, and ensure that the Canadian economy is positioned to be a global leader, now and into the future.”





















Irek Kusmierczyk

Member of Parliament for Windsor-Tecumseh




“Through this federal investment, our strong partnership with WEtech Alliance will further strengthen our regional economy in Windsor-Essex and Chatham-Kent, and it will support innovative tech entrepreneurs and businesses driving a greener future in southwestern Ontario.”




















Drew Dilkens

Mayor, City of Windsor



“This is a thriving time for innovation and entrepreneurship in southwestern Ontario. This funding aligns with the City of Windsor’s economic diversification strategy – Windsor Works – and strengthens the linkages that will help scale up new ventures to create jobs and grow our regional economy.” 




















Darrin Canniff

Mayor, Municipality of Chatham-Kent




“This announcement is great news for Chatham-Kent as we continue our journey to embrace green tech and future-thinking innovation.”



“We know that WEtech Alliance will work diligently to ensure these funds are distributed to the many worthy businesses in Chatham-Kent that are on the cutting edge of green technology and will further stimulate our already growing local economy.”





















Gary McNamara

Warden, Essex County




“This program will direct funding and support to the people most likely to maximize its potential – the entrepreneurs and trailblazers in Windsor-Essex focused on agri-innovation, clean technology and a greener economy.”



“WEtech Alliance has the vision, the knowledge and the connections to ensure this funding is funneled to the innovative businesses that can best leverage it to create jobs and new and better systems and products.”





















Adam Castle

Director of Venture Services, WEtech Alliance




“Early access to capital and expert mentorship are the most reported needs on our client intake form, and for good reason. Research has proven that to grow into globally competitive leaders, small and medium sized enterprises need equitable access to funding and expertise. The i.d.e.a Fund is primed to deliver both by empowering entrepreneurs to think differently and build bold solutions to our region’s most pressing challenges.”

MEDIA RELEASE via Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade
MARKHAM, ON., December 2, 2021 – The Ontario government has launched a flagship program to drive innovation and investment across Ontario’s electric, connected and autonomous vehicle sector. Its $56.4 million investment in the Ontario Vehicle Innovation Network (OVIN) is part of Driving Prosperity ― The Future of Ontario’s Automotive Sector, the government’s plan to drive deals and secure production mandates for hybrid and electric vehicles, create a domestic battery ecosystem, and strengthen Ontario’s position as a North American automotive and electric vehicle (EV) innovation hub.
At GM Canada’s Canadian Technical Centre (CTC) in Markham, Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade announced the province’s latest commitment to putting Ontario at the forefront of global demand for cleaner, safer, more sustainable transportation solutions.
Delivered in partnership with the Ontario Centre for Innovation (OCI), OVIN is Ontario’s response to the rising global demand for EV and Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) technologies and infrastructure. Building on the success of previous programs that encourage partnerships between small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), industry, academia and municipalities – OVIN will help to strengthen Ontario’s auto industry and make the province more competitive for new investments in EV and CAV technologies. It will act as Ontario’s hub for the province-wide coordination of activities and resources related to EV and CAV research and commercialization.
OVIN is anchored by six main objectives:
• Bridge Ontario’s technology and manufacturing clusters to support the growth of Ontario’s automotive sector.
• Advance the growth of regional clusters and world-class testing locations to drive the deployment, adoption, and piloting of smart mobility technologies across the province.
• Deliver ongoing support for SMEs in commercializing technologies, scaling-up, attracting investment, and accessing global markets.
• Strengthen Ontario’s automotive and mobility workforce and talent pipeline through skills development and training programs.
• Drive public education, research, analysis, thought leadership activities, and raise awareness of the opportunities for Ontario – and our global competitive advantages.
• Convene stakeholder groups, act as a bridge for collaborative partnerships, and serve as a concierge for new entrants into Ontario’s thriving ecosystem.
Combined with the province’s $85 million investment in the previous Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network (AVIN), Ontario’s total investment in this flagship initiative is almost $142 million.
Bold new initiatives include:
• An R&D Partnership Fund stream focused on electric vehicle and battery technologies
• Regional Technology Development Sites, with a new site to be established in Northern Ontario
• An OVIN Demonstration Zone, that will support real-time, on-road demonstrations to help Ontario firms showcase made-in-Ontario technologies to potential customers
• A Talent Development Program expanded to help attract and develop world-leading talent in the EV and CAV sector.
As a key element of the province’s Driving Prosperity Phase 2, OVIN will be the driving force behind the programming, province-wide coordination of activities and resources, and Ontario’s push to lead in the future of the automotive and mobility sector globally.
Together, Driving Prosperity and OVIN will position Ontario as a leading jurisdiction for new investments in for EV, CAV, battery technology, critical minerals and advanced manufacturing – reinforcing Ontario as the manufacturing hub of Canada.
“Together, OVIN and Driving Prosperity Phase 2 will support domestic parts producers, workers, and innovators across the province in responding to the global demand for electric and autonomous vehicles, and related technologies and infrastructure,” said Fedeli. “Right now across our province, over 300 businesses are already working on inventing the future of clean, connected transportation. Through OVIN, we’re continuing to invest in Ontario’s innovation ecosystem − making sure our innovators, entrepreneurs, and SMEs have the capital and support they need to bring Ontario-made EV and CAV solutions to the world.”
Positioning Ontario as a leading jurisdiction for investment in electrified and less carbon-intensive transportation technology is also part of the province’s plan to meet emission reduction targets and build a stronger, more sustainable Ontario.
“Ontario’s wheels are in motion to create a more sustainable future for the transportation sector. A critical pillar in our plan is strengthening Ontario’s position as an electric vehicle production hub, making these vehicles more accessible to drivers across the province,” said Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation. “Our new flagship program will go a long way towards supporting our talented workforce, driving electric vehicle research and development, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.”
“The OVIN initiative is a key component of propelling Ontario as a global leader in innovation,” said Logan Kanapathi, MPP for Markham-Thornhill. “As one of Canada’s top technology hubs, Markham-Thornhill has been at the forefront of driving innovation. Through OVIN, we will be better positioned to create a diverse innovation ecosystem led by collaboration, skill, and excellence.”
“Ontario’s OVIN initiative will drive made-in-Ontario electric and low-carbon vehicle technology development through collaborations with our many partners to help transform the province’s auto tech sector to build safer, cleaner and more efficient transportation,” said Dr Claudia Krywiak, President and CEO of Ontario Centre of Innovation.




Quick Facts:
• The 2021 Budget Ontario’s Action Plan: Protecting People’s Health and Our Economy announced the government’s $56.4 million investment from 2021 to 2024 to launch the Ontario Vehicle Innovation Network(OVIN). Combined with the province’s $85 million investment in the previous Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network (AVIN), Ontario’s total investment in this flagship initiative is almost $142 million.
• OVIN builds on the success of the AVIN initiative, which has already supported 372 SMEs, attracted $108 million in follow-on investment, supported 68 commercialization partnerships and created or retained 1,880 jobs.
• OVIN is part of Ontario’s Driving Prosperity Phase 2 auto strategy and builds on the significant momentum of almost $6 billion of investments into the province since fall 2020, much of it in the electric vehicle space.
• By 2030, it is estimated that one out of every three automobiles sold globally will be electric.
• Over the next five years, the size of the global autonomous car market is expected to nearly triple from $23B USD to $65B USD.
• More than 300 Ontario companies and organizations are active in the development of connected and autonomous vehicle technologies.
• In North America, Ontario ranks as the number two auto producer (after Michigan) and the number two Information Technology cluster (after California).

The program, branded as Scale(Back)UP in continuation with a branding refresh in 2020, will look to support the recovery of Windsor-Essex and Chatham-Kent businesses.
New this year, the Scale(Back)UP program – powered by Libro Credit Union and Invest WindsorEssex, will assist regional tech and tech-enabled companies to develop and execute on new strategies for revenue diversification, new market exploration, intellectual property development, and fundraising readiness.
Scale(Back)UP will select five (5) entrepreneurs who will receive four-months of intensive business mentoring + in-kind services valued at $15,000 + access to a global network of support + access to $500,000 in discounts and tech perks + 3 months of complimentary hot desk space at SOAR Innovation + the opportunity to pitch for a $20,000 top prize in front of the Windsor Essex Capital Angel Network (WECAN) and members of the Regional Alliance Windsor-Essex during Global Entrepreneurship Week in November 2021.
Selected companies will have fully customized strategies developed to assist them in uncovering new opportunities and finding new pathways to growth.




“Over the last 4 years, this program has become a slingshot for companies looking to steady their aim as they propel themselves into new markets, new specializations, and new ways to generate revenue” says Adam Castle, Director of Venture Services for WEtech Alliance. “As an organization deeply rooted in not just our community, but the Canadian technology ecosystem at large, the WEtech Alliance Business Advisory team has been steadily building inroads to new markets and resources so that we can create a broader audience for our portfolio clients, and our businesses can focus on what they do best, delivering highly scalable, world class products and services.”
Through its first 4 cohorts, ScaleUP has assisted 19 companies in getting 122 new products and services to market, engaging over 8.7 million users around the globe, and creating 150 jobs.
New for 2021, Invest WindsorEssex – with the support of The Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario) – has joined in partnership to help maximize the impact this program has on regional businesses. “After watching last year’s pitch competition, and getting to know the cohort, we wanted to supercharge the program and create more opportunities focussed on automobility entrepreneurship for this year’s cohort. With more mentorship hours, more prize money, and more resources being placed at the fingertips of these startups, we are excited to see the results on pitch day in November” said Matthew Johnson, Executive Director for Mobility Partnerships, and Innovation at Invest WindsorEssex.


“We continue to be amazed by the impact of the ScaleUP program in our region…”



The ScaleUP program evolved from the successful StartUP program funded by the Libro Prosperity Fund in 2016. In March 2020, the ScaleUP Accelerator was recognized nationally as one of fifteen winners of the Concentra Empowering Your Community Awards.
“We continue to be amazed by the impact of the ScaleUP program in our region, now in its fifth year in partnership with WEtech Alliance; there is great potential for positive impact and prosperous growth for businesses scaling up in a post-covid world! We are confident that the ScaleUP cohort will be ready to wow and inspire us again this year through the dedicated and innovative work of their founders, alongside the powerhouse program that WEtech Alliance has continued to refine year after year” says Lori Atkinson, Libro Credit Union, Regional Manager for Windsor-Essex.
ScaleUP is the first accelerator program in the region focused on scaling startups and that is open to entrepreneurs of all ages. Last year, five companies were selected out of thirty applications.
The deadline to apply for the fifth Cohort is 11:59pm on July 22nd, 2021.

Windsor, ON – January 7, 2021 – WEtech Alliance along with community partners have launched three (3) innovative pilot projects that will take a tangible and local approach to solving main street and small businesses biggest challenges amid COVID-19.


The Challenges




Through the Ignition program, supported by Libro Credit Union, WEtech Alliance connected with over one hundred (100) small and medium-sized main street businesses across Windsor-Essex and Chatham-Kent, to better understand the most pressing challenges facing local main streets.
“Getting main street businesses and entrepreneurs the support they need to get through this pandemic is critical to the growth of prosperity in Windsor-Essex and Chatham Kent. The Ignition program took a boots on the ground approach and showed up to speak with local business owners, understanding the challenges they are facing, so that we could build the solutions that would impact them the most,” said Lori Atkinson, Regional Manager at Libro Credit Union. “We know these solutions are going to make a big difference in people’s lives, and we are excited to see them in action.”
Following numerous conversations with business owners, community members and organizations from both main street and the innovation community, the Ignition program identified three (3) key challenges:


The Solutions




Through the Community Collaboration Projects, part of the Digital Main Street Future Proof Program and supported by the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario), the Government of Ontario, NORCAT, Communitech, and Invest Ottawa, WEtech Alliance engaged with local entrepreneurs and community partners to develop, implement and financially support tangible solutions to the three (3) key challenges highlighted through the Ignition program.
WEtech Alliance is pleased to support small businesses across Windsor-Essex and Chatham-Kent though the following three (3) solutions and pilot projects:




Entrepreneurs on the Front Lines Project: Leveraging the Canadian Mental Health Association Windsor-Essex County’s programming and expertise, this project aims to provide tailored and on-demand support, programming and resources to business owners, entrepreneurs, and their staff with the goal of ensuring well-being is a priority. The project will run in Windsor-Essex and Chatham-Kent, beginning on January 1, 2021 and run through to March 31, 2021.
Tourism + Tech: Sparking Tourism 4.0 Project: Leveraging the Ontario Tourism Innovation Lab’s (OTIL) Spark Program, this project aims to connect tourism and hospitality-based businesses and entrepreneurs with technology experts and providers to create and develop new and/or enhanced tourism opportunities, ideas, experiences and partnerships to further support the future proofing of the tourism industry. The project will run in Windsor-Essex and Chatham-Kent in conjunction with the OTIL’s Spark Program.
Shop My Town Project: Leveraging Windsor-based Splice Digital’s shopmytown innovative e-commerce platform, this project aims to connect local vendors with new and existing customers who like to shop local. The project will run in Windsor-Essex and Chatham-Kent, beginning on January 1, 2021 and run through to March 31, 2021. During the duration of the project, platform fees will be reduced to 3% (from 12%). In addition, business owners will have complimentary access to dedicated Customer Success Teams, in partnership with Communitech’s Future Proof Transformation Teams, who can help business owners get online and sell within one business day.


The Journey




“The Digital Main Street Community Collaboration Projects allowed us the opportunity to solve emerging local main street problems in real time while colliding them with the local innovation community,” said Yvonne Pilon, President and CEO at WEtech Alliance. “Over the next three months, business owners, entrepreneurs, BIAs, small business enterprise centres, chambers of commerce and municipalities across Windsor-Essex and Chatham-Kent will have additional support to assist in the future proofing and wellbeing of our local business community.”
All solutions were evaluated on the strength of community and end-user collaborations, scalability to other businesses and regions and supporting economic viability of main street and broader ecosystem.
Business owners, main street businesses, BIAs, SBECs or municipalities interested in leveraging the following projects/solutions, can contact Noah Campbell at [email protected] for instructions on how to get started.

Pilot Projects to Focus on Generating Revenue Online, Mental Health and Tourism Innovation








Windsor, ON – January 7, 2021 – WEtech Alliance along with community partners have launched three (3) innovative pilot projects that will take a tangible and local approach to solving main street and small businesses biggest challenges amid COVID-19.


The Challenges




Through the Ignition program, supported by Libro Credit Union, WEtech Alliance connected with over one hundred (100) small and medium-sized main street businesses across Windsor-Essex and Chatham-Kent, to better understand the most pressing challenges facing local main streets.
“Getting main street businesses and entrepreneurs the support they need to get through this pandemic is critical to the growth of prosperity in Windsor-Essex and Chatham Kent. The Ignition program took a boots on the ground approach and showed up to speak with local business owners, understanding the challenges they are facing, so that we could build the solutions that would impact them the most,” said Lori Atkinson, Regional Manager at Libro Credit Union. “We know these solutions are going to make a big difference in people’s lives, and we are excited to see them in action.”
Following numerous conversations with business owners, community members and organizations from both main street and the innovation community, the Ignition program identified three (3) key challenges:


The Solutions




Through the Community Collaboration Projects, part of the Digital Main Street Future Proof Program and supported by the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario), the Government of Ontario, NORCAT, Communitech, and Invest Ottawa, WEtech Alliance engaged with local entrepreneurs and community partners to develop, implement and financially support tangible solutions to the three (3) key challenges highlighted through the Ignition program.
WEtech Alliance is pleased to support small businesses across Windsor-Essex and Chatham-Kent though the following three (3) solutions and pilot projects:




Entrepreneurs on the Front Lines Project: Leveraging the Canadian Mental Health Association Windsor-Essex County’s programming and expertise, this project aims to provide tailored and on-demand support, programming and resources to business owners, entrepreneurs, and their staff with the goal of ensuring well-being is a priority. The project will run in Windsor-Essex and Chatham-Kent, beginning on January 1, 2021 and run through to March 31, 2021.
Tourism + Tech: Sparking Tourism 4.0 Project: Leveraging the Ontario Tourism Innovation Lab’s (OTIL) Spark Program, this project aims to connect tourism and hospitality-based businesses and entrepreneurs with technology experts and providers to create and develop new and/or enhanced tourism opportunities, ideas, experiences and partnerships to further support the future proofing of the tourism industry. The project will run in Windsor-Essex and Chatham-Kent in conjunction with the OTIL’s Spark Program.
Shop My Town Project: Leveraging Windsor-based Splice Digital’s shopmytown innovative e-commerce platform, this project aims to connect local vendors with new and existing customers who like to shop local. The project will run in Windsor-Essex and Chatham-Kent, beginning on January 1, 2021 and run through to March 31, 2021. During the duration of the project, platform fees will be reduced to 3% (from 12%). In addition, business owners will have complimentary access to dedicated Customer Success Teams, in partnership with Communitech’s Future Proof Transformation Teams, who can help business owners get online and sell within one business day.


The Journey




“The Digital Main Street Community Collaboration Projects allowed us the opportunity to solve emerging local main street problems in real time while colliding them with the local innovation community,” said Yvonne Pilon, President and CEO at WEtech Alliance. “Over the next three months, business owners, entrepreneurs, BIAs, small business enterprise centres, chambers of commerce and municipalities across Windsor-Essex and Chatham-Kent will have additional support to assist in the future proofing and wellbeing of our local business community.”
All solutions were evaluated on the strength of community and end-user collaborations, scalability to other businesses and regions and supporting economic viability of main street and broader ecosystem.
Business owners, main street businesses, BIAs, SBECs or municipalities interested in leveraging the following projects/solutions, can contact Noah Campbell at [email protected] for instructions on how to get started.
